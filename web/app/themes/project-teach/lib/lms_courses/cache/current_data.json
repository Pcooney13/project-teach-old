This is critical for your primary care practice, as this condition affects up to 19 percent of mothers and newborns. The risk is even higher in some populations. Symptoms can progress to include psychosis, suicidal thoughts, or thoughts of harming themselves or their infant. Even without these extremes, women who are affected by postpartum depression are less likely to provide their infants with enriched environments. Children of depressed mothers can exhibit psychiatric symptoms themselves even within just two years.
